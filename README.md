# Graph Learning Project

This repository contains the code of the "Praktikum Graph Learning" class at the RWTH Aachen in the summer semester 2022, by Lea Marxen, Haron Shaker and Peihong Shi. The class was divided into five exercises, where we built different Graph Learning models like Graph Neural Networks. The fifth exercise consists of a competetion to find the best models for three different Graph Classification problems.

## Organization

The five exercises are contained in separate folders, each folder including an individual Readme for the respective exercise.
